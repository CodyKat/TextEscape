This web platform is a text game platform that escapes rooms in various situations. The design is simply a background picture and a text explaining the situation in the middle. It consists of the parts underneath the text that write down the answers when making each choice or solving a partial problem.

We're going to put Google ads on the web, so we need to make sure there's a proper place for Google ads. And when you make each choice or choose a game, the page moves to retrieve the Google ads.

The progress of the game, the puzzle, and the description of the situation are all in text. "You're in a dark room. There's an old door on the front and a bookshelf on the right. It's like: (1) Door Survey (2) Bookshop Survey." The next text changes depending on the choice.

Users have no choice but to go around my web service very often and quickly because there are several clues hidden to escape the room. That's why I plan to have as many static pages as possible when I build a project later.

It's text-based, but the background changes the representative image depending on the puzzle concept and situation of each game, and the text feels like typing.
