This web platform is a text game platform that escapes rooms in various situations. The design is simply a background picture and a text explaining the situation in the middle. It consists of the parts underneath the text that write down the answers when making each choice or solving a partial problem.

The progress of the game, the puzzle, and the description of the situation are all in text. "You're in a dark room. There's an old door on the front and a bookshelf on the right. It's like: (1) Door Survey (2) Bookshop Survey." The next text changes depending on the choice.

It's text-based, but the background changes the representative image depending on the puzzle concept and situation of each game, and the text feels like typing.
